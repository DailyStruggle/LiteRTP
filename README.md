A spigot plugin for random teleportation.
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/rtp.94812/

The goal of this plugin is function over form, 
 * unique geometry to produce flat random distributions and support a learning algorithm
 * unique methods to learn from placements and avoid redundant selections, e.g. trying the same ocean thousands of times
 * region-based design, supporting any number of rtp regions per world
 * per-world and per-region configuration and teleport permissions
 * adjustment of region and world settings by command or by config file 
 * adjustment of all plugin messages in lang.yml
