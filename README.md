# RTP
[abandoned]

I'm not supporting this anymore. The public is free to do whatever they want with the software.

There are probably some bugs remaining and memory usage isn't great with an in-memory database. It's hard to pin down everything. Regardless, I hope the codebase provides a good example for optimization via mathematical modeling.

## Overview
A spigot plugin for random teleportation.
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/rtp.94812/

The goal of this plugin is function over form, 
 * unique geometry to produce flat random distributions and support a learning algorithm
 * unique methods to learn from placements and avoid redundant selections, e.g. trying the same ocean thousands of times
 * region-based design, supporting any number of rtp regions per world
 * per-world and per-region configuration and teleport permissions
 * adjustment of region and world settings by command or by config file 
 * adjustment of all plugin messages, except for utility logs
 
## Build Instructions
This codebase was put together in Intellij IDEA. You can open the base directory as a project, trust the sources, and build as-is with maven.

## Shapes
The plugin has some pretty useful shapes by default - 

circle, using an exponential distribution of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0

This plugin also allows arbitrary shape addition via API calls.
