# RTP
A spigot plugin for random teleportation.

The goal of this plugin is function over form, 
 * unique geometry to produce flat random distributions 
 * per-world configuration
 * per-world teleport permission
 * tasks to distribute chunk preloading over time, since Spigot doesn't support async chunk loading
 * (done) adjustment of world settings both by command and by config file
